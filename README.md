### Summary

**PodSens** is an end-to-end AI-powered platform designed to automate podcast
post-production workflows. The system transforms a single audio file upload into
a comprehensive multi-platform content distribution package, reducing manual
content creation time from hours to minutes.

---

### ⚡ Technical Highlight

**Parallel AI processing with Inngest (5x faster than sequential)**

Instead of waiting 5 minutes for AI tasks to run one-by-one, we run 6 AI
generation jobs simultaneously. Your content is ready in ~90 seconds total.

## 🤔 What Is This App?

Here's the simple explanation:

1. **You upload** one audio file (your podcast episode)
2. **AI analyzes** your content, understanding speakers, topics, and key moments
3. **You get** a complete content distribution package:
   - Summary with key insights
   - Social media posts tailored for Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram, TikTok,
     YouTube, and Facebook
   - Title suggestions (short, long, SEO-optimized)
   - Platform-specific hashtags
   - YouTube chapter timestamps
   - Key moments for viral clips
   - Full transcript with speaker identification

**The workflow:** Record → Upload → AI Analyzes → Get Distribution Content

## 📊 Database Schema Overview

### Main Model: `projects` Table

The entire application revolves around a single `projects` table in Convex. This
denormalized structure allows for atomic updates and real-time reactivity.

**Key Fields:**

| Field               | Type   | Description                                                 |
| ------------------- | ------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `userId`            | string | Clerk user ID (links project to user)                       |
| `inputUrl`          | string | Vercel Blob URL for uploaded file                           |
| `status`            | enum   | `uploaded` → `processing` → `completed` or `failed`         |
| `jobStatus`         | object | Granular status for `transcription` and `contentGeneration` |
| `transcript`        | object | Full transcript with segments, speakers, chapters           |
| `summary`           | object | AI-generated summary with bullets, insights, TLDR           |
| `socialPosts`       | object | Platform-specific posts (Twitter, LinkedIn, etc.)           |
| `titles`            | object | Title suggestions (YouTube, podcast, SEO)                   |
| `hashtags`          | object | Platform-specific hashtag recommendations                   |
| `youtubeTimestamps` | array  | Chapter markers for YouTube descriptions                    |
| `keyMoments`        | array  | Viral clip opportunities with timestamps                    |

**Design Decisions:**

- **Denormalized structure** - All data in one document for atomic updates
- **Optional fields** - Allow progressive population as Inngest jobs complete
- **Indexes** - Optimize queries by user, status, and creation date
- **Real-time reactivity** - Convex subscriptions trigger UI updates
  automatically

**Indexes:**

- `by_user` - List all projects for a user
- `by_status` - Filter by processing status
- `by_user_and_status` - User's active/completed projects
- `by_created_at` - Sort by newest first

---

## 🚀 Deployment

### Vercel Deployment (Recommended)

1. **Push your code to GitHub**

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git push origin main
```

2. **Import to Vercel**

- Go to [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com)
- Click "Import Project"
- Select your GitHub repository
- Vercel will auto-detect Next.js

3. **Add environment variables**

In Vercel dashboard → Settings → Environment Variables, add all variables from
your `.env.local`

4. **Deploy**

Vercel will automatically deploy on every push to `main`

5. **Configure custom domain** (optional)

Settings → Domains → Add your domain

### Monitoring & Observability

Keep an eye on these dashboards:

- **Inngest Dashboard** - Workflow execution logs, retry attempts, failures
- **Convex Dashboard** - Database queries, performance metrics, real-time
  connections
- **Vercel Analytics** - Traffic, page views, edge function performance
- **Clerk Dashboard** - User signups, active subscriptions, billing events

---

### Important Concepts

**Plan-based Feature Gating**

Features are enabled based on the user's Clerk subscription tier:

- **Free**: Summary only (3 projects lifetime)
- **Pro**: + Social posts, titles, hashtags (30 projects/month)
- **Ultra**: + YouTube timestamps, key moments, full transcript (unlimited)

**Parallel AI Processing**

Instead of running AI generation tasks sequentially (slow), Inngest runs 6 jobs
in parallel using `Promise.allSettled`. This reduces processing time from ~5
minutes to ~60 seconds.

**Real-time Updates**

Convex subscriptions (`useQuery`) automatically re-render components when
database data changes. No polling, no manual refetching. As Inngest updates the
project status, the UI updates instantly.

**Durable Execution**

Inngest provides automatic retry logic. If OpenAI times out or AssemblyAI fails,
the step retries with exponential backoff. Your users never lose work.
